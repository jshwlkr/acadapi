# acadapi

Not ready for production. It's not quite querying the API correctly, styling is needs lots of attention.  
Future updates will likely not be backwards compatible.  
This is a CGB plugin.  Intent was/is this would eventually offer a series of blocks based on querying various academic APIs.  
  
Give it a DOI. It will return a paper's title, link, and author via Crossref's API.
